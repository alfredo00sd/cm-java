## Mortgage calculator.
Simple calculator on command line app.

## Mortgage equation
   ##### Formula : `M = P r(1+r)^n / (1+r)^n -1`
## Rate equation
   ##### Formula : `n% = n / 100`. 
   This result is divided by 12 and you will get the rate
    
## Variables
* M is your monthly payment.
* P is your principal.
* r is your monthly interest rate, calculated by dividing your annual interest rate by 12.
* n is your number of payments (the number of months you will be paying the loan)
        
# Schedule payments.
  ##### Formula : `B = L[(1+c)^n - (1+c)^p] / [(c+1)^n - 1]`
   * L(Long time payment) = principal.
   *  c = monthly interest.
   *  p = number of payments made.
   *  n = number of payments.
   *  B = remind balance.
